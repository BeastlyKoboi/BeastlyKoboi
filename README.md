### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Allan Flores despite what my username may think. I am a 3rd year RIT student studying Game Design and Development with a graduation date of December 2024. 
My interests are not restricted to games however, as my earnest goal is to make things both approachable and fulfilling, whether that be a simple useful tool or an application for entertainment.
